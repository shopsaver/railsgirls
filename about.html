            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>At <strong>FindHuntr</strong>, our mission is clear: to foster a safer digital world by bridging the gap between organizations and ethical hackers.

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>We enable organizations of all sizes—from startups to enterprises—to protect their digital assets by launching security programs tailored to their needs. Here’s what makes FindHuntr unique:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bug Bounty Programs (BBPs)</strong>: Organizations reward security researchers for finding and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities, providing a strong incentive for ethical hacking. With our platform, companies can clearly define their scope, manage vulnerability submissions, and issue rewards based on the severity of findings.</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (VDPs)</strong>: We facilitate responsible disclosure by offering companies a structured channel to receive, triage, and respond to vulnerability reports without financial incentives. This builds trust and shows a strong commitment to cybersecurity.</li>
                <li><strong>Private Programs</strong>: When organizations require specialized focus, our Private Programs allow them to engage with a curated selection of trusted security researchers. This approach ensures deep, targeted testing while keeping sensitive assets confidential.</li>
            </ul>
